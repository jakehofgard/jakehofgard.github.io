Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, I've enjoyed teaching a variety of mathematical courses. Before I was qualified to TA for the courses listed below, I was in charge of tutoring program operated jointly by the Stanford math department and the Stanford University Mathematics Organization ([SUMO](https://sumo.stanford.edu/tutoring.html)). From 2021 to 2024, I tutored for introductory undergraduate courses in calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. 

Winter 2025 – Math 51 (Stanford University)
======

An introductory course on linear algebra and multivariable calculus, geared towards first-year undergraduates. I held discussion sections (~30 students, twice a week), office hours, and graded exams. You can read students' reviews of my teaching for Math 51 [here](../files/JakeHofgard_math51_reviews.pdf).

Fall 2024 – Math 220A (Stanford University)
======

A graduate-level introduction to the theory of partial differential equations. Solution methods and regularity estimates for elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations, including the method of characteristics, basic theory of weak solutions, and Fourier-analytic approaches. You can read students' reviews of my teaching for Math 220A [here](../files/JakeHofgard_math220a_reviews.pdf).

Winter 2024 – EE 364A (Stanford University)
======


A graduate-level introduction to convex optimization, with an eye towards applications. Covers the basics of convex analysis and convex duality, many examples from control, statistics, finance, and engineering, and concludes with an introduction to the inner workings of interior point methods.
